{0} is a game about creating a team of adventurers and sending them off to clear dungeons while you take care of the loot and materials they find.
This glossary page will attempt to provide some additional information on some of the key features of this game.
A {0} is an adventurer that can be sent to clear dungeons and collect loot for you. You can have up to {1} total {2}.
A {0} can be one of {1} Classes that each have {2} Default Skills, {3} Offensive Cooldowns and {4} Defensive Cooldowns to choose from.
Each {0} once level {1} can be upgraded into an Ascendancy Class, each base class has {2} Ascendancy Classes to choose from.
Each level or Ascendancy level that a {0} gains will reward a passive point that can be used to upgrade their power.
{0} is an item that can be equipped to a Character. Each character has multiple {1} slots that can be filled.
{0} is primarily obtained from slaying Monsters. Some {1} can also be crafted up to a certain quality while {2} Items cannot be crafted and can only be looted.
Most types of {0} can be obtained from Level {1} however Accessories can only be obtained from level {2} onwards and Relics can only be obtained from level {3} onwards.
{0} can drop at various rarity levels starting from {1} and raising in quality until {2}.
Each new rarity tier will introduce a new attribute slot to the item and will provide higher base attribute ranks.
Holding Ctrl while looking at a piece of unequipped {0} will provide a comparison tooltip that will show the approximate stat difference between the new item and the currently equipped one. (Note that the comparison values don't take into account sockets or enchants.)
Holding Shift and Left Clicking a piece of {0} will attempt to Equip or Unequip it.
A {0} is an encounter between {1}-{2} Characters facing off against the Monsters of a dungeon before attempting to slay the Boss.
Up to {0} {1} slots can be purchased allowing for multiple different dungeons to be run at the same time.
Running a {0} will grant Expertise which can be used to purchase upgrades for the Dungeon being run. Expertise upgrades can increase the difficulty and also the rewards of the dungeon. Running a {1} that is lower level than the participants will reward reduced or even no Expertise.
Successfully clearing multiple Boss floors in a {0} will grant a stacking buff that rewards additional higher quality loot until the party is defeated.
{0} occupy Missions and must be defeated in order to progress to the next floor.
Level {0}+ {1} have a {2} base chance to spawn as {3} increasing their stats and rewards.
Level {0}+ {1} have a {2} base chance to spawn as {3} increasing their stats and rewards.
Level {0}+ {1} have a {2} base chance to spawn as {3} increasing their stats and rewards and granting access to Nemesis Items.
In addition to rarity Level {0}+ {1} have a {2} base chance to spawn with an elemental empowerment granting new skills and modifying their damage type.
Slaying a Boss will reward a Loot Chest of minimum {0} quality which can be opened with right click.
{0} takes place on the combat menu in the form of a simulated battle between player Characters and enemy Monsters.
Each in game tick ({0}) will progress the Character and Monsters action bar. Once full the default attack or current monster ability will be cast.
When all opposing Monsters are defeated the next stage will be selected and new monsters will spawn. By default {0}-{1} Monsters will spawn per wave depending on the number of Characters on the Mission.
Should all Characters be defeated a {0} will occur. Should a restart mode be selected the Mission will automatically restart after a game over.
The {0} option will attempt to restart the Mission after the Boss stage is completed should {1} or more Characters be defeated.
{0} is a very important part of the game. {1} allows for the collection of Crafting Materials from spare items and equipment.
Items can be {0} by placing them into the Scrapper (once unlocked) or automatically depending on your Auto Scrap configuration (Unlockable).
{0} and {1} materials that you receive through {2} can be {3} into lower quality versions by Ctrl + Right Clicking them in the Material Inventory.
Any Item that is dropped but cannot be placed into the inventory due to lack of space or suitable bag filters will be automatically scrapped and you will receive the materials instead. (Note that unequipped items or Reward Chest items will force themselves into the inventory ignoring any bag filters if necessary.)
Material Tiers in {0} are as follows:
Tier {0}: Level {1}
{0} is an essential component of the game. {1} can be used to generate new items or modify existing items.
Items generated from {0} can only be {1} up to {2} quality to encourage hunting for rarer items from Missions.
Crafting provides the ability to almost completely customize the stats of most {0} that you find.
This includes: Rerolling the attributes, randomising the attribute ranks, locking the attributes to make it easier to reroll the rest and upgrading the attribute ranks thereby increase the value of the stat each attribute grants.
In addition {0} can be used to add Sockets to items and Enchant them later in the game.
{0} can be accessed from the Upgrade Menu and provide the means of unlocking additional content and game features.
Each {0} must be first unlocked which can be done by following the hint text.
Once unlocked a {0} can be purchased and upgrade using various Crafting Materials and Currency to do so.
Some {0} offer quality of life such as Automatic Casting or Scrapping. Others offer new features such as Professions, Bonus Stages or Loadout Slots.
{0} provide a means of passively collecting Crafting Materials.
By Default each {0} Worker slot will generate {1} {2} resource per Harvest and has a {3} chance to additionally generate a {4} resource.
{0} Workers Slots can be equipped with {1} that will augment the number of Crafting Materials obtained and the chance for {2} resources to be found.
Socketed {0} can be acquired after Level {1} allowing for {2} to be used.
Socketed {0} can be identified by small white dots on the item icon representing the number of present sockets. Additionally the item tooltip will display the number of available sockets.
{0} can be equipped at any point but will only become active once the corresponding Socket has been unlocked by equipping socketed {1}.
Most {0} have fixed attributes with a Set Bonus that is granted when a specific number of {1} of the same type are equipped.
{0} can either be Crafted or Looted depending on what upgrades have been unlocked.
{0} can be unlocked at Level {1} and can be Crafted and Upgraded on the {2} Menu.
{0} provide a way to grant Passive or Active bonuses to your Characters while in Combat.
{0} use charges to activate and must be refilled from the {1} Menu using Crafting Materials gathered from the Farming Profession.
Some {0} provide very powerful effects but require a {1} resource to refill and so should be used carefully.
Upon reaching level {0} each {1} can select an {2} which will unlock a powerful new cooldown ability and reward a new {3} Relic.

{0} has several different {1}. These {1} are typically split between 3 different groups:
{0}: {1}, {2}, and {3}. These {4} vary based on the Weapon used. Default attacks require specific {0} while Offensive Cooldowns inherit {0} from your Equipped Weapons.
{0}: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, and {5}. These {6} are tied to the Skills used.
{0}: {1} attacks hit only 1 target while {2} attacks hit more than 1 target.
In addition to these {0} there are some other Damage Methods that require explanation:
{0}: Effects that deal {0} inherit the {1} of the Skill that triggered it.
{0}: Effects that deal {0} inherit the {1} of the current {2}. In addition the Damage of these effects is scaled by Attack Speed, Critical Strike Chance / Damage and Double / Triple Damage chance.
{0} are a form of endgame content that becomes available while progressing through the {1} system.

In addition as you increase the {0} of a Mission your chance to encounter {1} or even {2} will increase.
{0} can be run any number of times by any number of teams and a {1} is provided to allow for the storage of your favourite Modifier Loadouts.

{0} represent different groups within {1} that you can assist by defeating Monsters in their associated {2}.
{0} are long and challenging missions that require you to defeat multiple mini bosses before facing the final boss. {0} will test your teams endurance.
Defeating Monsters in {0} will grant {1} reputation. Defeating the final boss of each {2} will grant a large amount of reputation.
